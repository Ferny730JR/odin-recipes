		<h2>Description</h2>
		<p>
			From Wikipedia. A Buffalo wing in American cuisine is an unbreaded chicken
			wing section (flat or drumette) that is generally deep-fried, then coated
			or dipped in a sauce consisting of a vinegar-based cayenne pepper hot
			sauce and melted butter prior to serving. They are traditionally served
			hot, along with celery sticks and carrot sticks, and a dip of blue cheese
			dressing or, primarily outside of New York, ranch dressing. Buffalo wings
			are named after Buffalo, New York, where they were invented, and have no
			relation to the animal. They are often called simply chicken wings, hot
			wings, or just wings.
