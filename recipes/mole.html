			cuisine. In contemporary Mexico the term is used for a number of sauces".
		</p>
		<h3>Ingredients</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>1 jar (8.25 oz) Doña Maria Mole Sauce</li>
			<li>4-6 pieces of chicken breasts</li>
			<li>4 cups chicken broth (or water)</li>
			<li>1 tbsp peanut butter (optional, for added creaminess)</li>
			<li>1-2 tbsp sugar (optional, to balance flavors)</li>
			<li>2 tbsp vegetable oil</li>
			<li>Warm tortillas (for serving)</li>
			<li>
				Optional toppings: sesame seeds, chopped cilantro, or sliced onions
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Steps</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>
				In a large pot, add the chicken pieces and cover them with water or
				broth. Add a pinch of salt, and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to a simmer
				and cook until the chicken is fully cooked (about 20-30 minutes)
			</li>
			<li>
				Once cooked, remove the chicken from the pot and set aside. Reserve the
				broth for the mole sauce
			</li>
			<li>
				In a medium-sized saucepan, heat 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil over
				medium heat
			</li>
			<li>
				Scoop the Doña Maria Mole Sauce into the pan and stir continuously to
				soften the paste (about 2-3 minutes)
			</li>
			<li>
				Gradually add 3-4 cups of the reserved chicken broth, stirring
				constantly to dissolve the mole paste. The consistency should be thick
				but pourable; adjust with more broth or water as needed
			</li>
			<li>
				If you like, mix in 1 tablespoon of peanut butter and 1-2 tablespoons of
				sugar to enhance the sauce's creaminess and sweetness
			</li>
			<li>
				Simmer the mole sauce for 5-10 minutes, stirring occasionally to prevent
				sticking
			</li>
			<li>
				Add the cooked chicken pieces to the mole sauce, ensuring they are fully
				coated. Simmer together for another 5-10 minutes to allow the flavors to
				meld
			</li>
			<li>
				Serve the chicken mole with warm tortillas and sides like rice or beans.
				Garnish with sesame seeds, chopped cilantro, or sliced onions if desired
			</li>
		</ol>
